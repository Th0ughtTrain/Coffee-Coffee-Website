# Coffee Coffee website

## Table of Contents



### Introduction

The idea of this website came about as somewhat of a challenge. While I was already considering mock website designs I was considering designing ideas that were interesting but also weren't tied to anything I was personally interested in. I'm personally not a coffee drinker though I know many who are, and felt like making a mock coffee website would serve as a good choice to fufill these requirments.

### Development 

Because I wasn't in to coffee myself I needed to do research into different coffee shops and see what elements were needed to make a good coffee shop design. Also I wanted to add limited functionality to it which included a cart and checkout page. 

I sketched out the initial layout and also ended up simultaneously designing the look in Lunacy while I was coding it. I was also able to have the items in the cart persist across all of the pages.
